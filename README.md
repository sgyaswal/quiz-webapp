This is a quiz application project created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deployed on Github Pages
Project is deployed on github and can be accessed using [this](https://github.com/sgyaswal/quiz-webapp) link.

## Progress with the project
- The project was not that much complicated and required only common functionalities so any major problems were not really observed.
- Though there are some UI bugs that can be easily fixed with some CSS enhancements.
- Complete code is divided into its own module so the code is not cluttered much and is very easy to read and maintain.
